# Desktop Environment Showcase

Desktop Environment Showcase is a small project meant to create screenshot of
'stock' configurations of most Linux desktop environments.

It is based on an Arch Linux Vagrant box, and some python scripts to automate
the setup and startup of each desktop environment.

I've built this since those UIs tend to change regularly, but I'm too lazy to
create VMs to try those out regularly, so creating screenshots of the desktop
is a good compromise in my opinion.
